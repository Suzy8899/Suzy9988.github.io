I am currently a lecturer at College of Urban Transportation and Logistics, Shenzhen Technology University. Before that, I obtained dual Ph.D. degrees at both Tongji University and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2025. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor degrees from both Beijing Jiaotong University and Rochester Institute of Technology in 2019. In the period from Jan. 2018 to May 2018, I studied at Rochester Institute of Technology as an exchange student. My research focuses on the modeling, analysis, and coordinated control of multimodal transport systems—particularly during large-scale passenger flow events. I aim to develop innovative strategies for enhancing evacuation efficiency, safety, and service quality by integrating ride-hailing services with public transit systems.
